# Debugging is a process of identifying and fixing problems (also known as BUGS) in code.

"""
Bug in any programming language is a problem that you have in your program and things are
not working as you expect it to work. So you do kind of like thorough analysis of your code 
and you find out that problematic area and you fix it. So that's what is called fixing a bug.
