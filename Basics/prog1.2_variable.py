In any programming language when you try to store number it ultimately numbers are stored in binary 
which is sequence of 0 and 1 and the way floating numbers are stored they always lose the accuracy.
There is no precise way to store floating numbers hence We will get this number 0.299999999 this is
not just with python, this is with any programming languages and it's expected. So it's not bug or 
anything. It's an expected output.
